### **Abstract**

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread social disruption and exacerbated the burden of anxiety and depression symptoms. Parents of school-aged children were impacted by school closures and distance learning, and it is critical to assess their mental health outcomes.

Objective: To document differences in anxiety and depression symptoms among parents who experienced different levels of disruption to their childrenâ€™s mode of school instruction.

Methods: Data are from the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey, an online survey of U.S. adults. The study includes Phases 2 and 3, which ran between August 2020 and March 2021. Adults with one or more child under 18 in their household were included. Outcome prevalence measures in each group were standardized to the national distribution of age, gender, race/ethnicity, and income.

Results: For both mothers and fathers, anxiety symptom prevalence was 13 percentage points higher among those experiencing cancelled school compared to no change in schooling, and 8 percentage points higher for distance learning compared to no change. Depression symptom prevalence was 10 percentage points higher for mothers, and 11 higher for fathers, when comparing cancelled school to no change. It was 6 percentage points higher for both mothers and fathers when comparing distance learning to no change. These trends were consistent across all but six states.

Conclusion: Parents experiencing school disruption also experienced high rates of anxiety and depression symptoms. These disparate outcomes cannot be explained by simple demographic differences and suggest a need for additional mental health support in areas experiencing school disruption.
